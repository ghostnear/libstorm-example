# Libstorm Example Project
Can be used as a small start to begin with [libstorm](https://github.com/ghostnear/libstorm).

Use any of the scripts in the /scripts folder to build the app.

## Requirements

- cmake
- Ninja if you build on Linux, you can remove this in the build.sh file if you don't like it.
- a C++ compiler, of course.
- [libstorm](https://github.com/ghostnear/libstorm) which is included as a github submodule in the /external folder.

### [Trello board for issues / features](https://trello.com/b/SohEE8iV/libstorm-issues-features)

If you find any issue with the example, feel free to open an issue here, on github. I will take the ones I see as relevant and them on the Trello board.
